## Key Design Principles

1. **Distributed Architecture**: Scalable host-client model for managing GPU clusters
2. **Fault Tolerance**: Resilient communication with automatic recovery
3. **Resource Efficiency**: Smart resource allocation and management
4. **Modularity**: Component-based design for flexibility and maintainability
5. **Performance**: Optimized for high-throughput GPU workloads

## Architecture Diagrams

The documents in this section contain detailed architectural diagrams and design specifications that explain how GSwarm's components work together to provide a unified GPU cluster management platform.
